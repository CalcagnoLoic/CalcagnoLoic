I'm a developer with a passion for web development and data processing technologies.
During my studies, I was able to discover the world of coding with R and data processing combined with biostatistics. After my studies, I started to learn Python on my own, and it was a real revelation for me. I wanted to turn my passion into my profession. 

So I decided to retrain in the world of web development, using the classic programming languages Javascript and PHP  at [BeCode](https://becode.org/fr/apprendre/developpeur-web-junior/). During this transition, I was able to complete a few months' internship at [I-care](https://www.icareweb.com/fr/) as a data engineer. During this internship, I was able to consolidate my skills in Python and learn about data engineering and NLP techniques. 

I'm currently perfecting my fullstack skills in React/TS and Python in collaboration with NX_academy. I develop solutions for frontend/fullstack projects. In addition, I have two junior developers under my wing with whom I'm working to build their skills in React and the JavaScript environment. 

Thanks to a few years working alongside senior developers and my self-taught work, I've been able to acquire a solid grounding in various technologies. 

- Development tools: ![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/Git-E34F26?style=for-the-badge&logo=git&logoColor=white)
- Frontend technologies: 
- Backend technologies: 
- Database: 
- Testing technologies: 
- Libraries for data exploration and ML:

Alongside these technical skills, I've obviously been working on my soft-skills. Namely, teamwork, public speaking, code popularization, solution-oriented thinking, and so on.

Let's keep in touch for more information or future collaboration ðŸ˜Š! Take a look at my [portfolio](https://calcagno-loic.netlify.app/) to discover my world and the projects I've worked on.
